        <p>https://www.bbc.com/ is appealing because :</p>
        <ol> 
            <li>It is easy to navigate.</li>
            <li>It provides news that is less biased than other platforms, like social media.</li>
            <li>It doesn't keep track of every news article you see and makes the algorithm make you see more of the same type of article</li>
        </ol>
        <p>I encourage people to visit the site if they want information and want to see a easy to navigate website</p>
        <hr>
        <p>https://www.tiktok.com/foryou is unappealing to me because:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The site is meant to be viewed in a mobile app, so the website takes up only the center of the screen.</li>
            <li>It can be hard to navigate the cite due to almost everything on the screen being a button.</li>
            <li>The algorithm can put videos you don't want to see on your screen due to you watching a video that was slightly similar.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>I do not encourage anyone to view this site on a PC. Stick to the app version.</p>
        <p>The site could be improved by making the videos bigger and putting more space between the buttons.</p>
